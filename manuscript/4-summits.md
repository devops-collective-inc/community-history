# Summits
In late 2012, the year we'd started PowerShell.org, some of us were speaking at a TechMentor Events conference on Microsoft's campus. We booked a side lunch with some of the PowerShell product team's leaders. 

We'd always figured that we'd eventually run our own "PowerShell Deep Dive" event, but the product team made it clear that they needed us to do it _now_, please, and that they couldn't give us a single red cent to make it happen. Wisely, they knew Microsoft would eventually get distracted and withdraw funding, so they needed the event to survive on its own, detached from fickle corporate interests.

And so, quite ahead of schedule, PowerShell Summit 2013 was invented for April of 2013. We minimized expenses by holding our 100-person event in two conference rooms on Microsoft's campus. The rooms were actually right off the lobbies of two adjacent buildings, and so we spent three days criss-crossing the courtyard between them as sessions changed. The expenses were not zero, though, and deposits were required to secure things like food and hotel space. Those deposits went on our personal credit cards. The day the last ticket was sold, we heaved an exhausted sigh of relief and started paying our credit card bills. Standing in the courtyard, hoping Bellevue's notoriously wet weather could hold off for another day, it finally occurred to us what we'd pulled off. I won't say that no small, quiet tears of relief were shed, because that'd be a lie.

_When are you going to hold a Summit in_ (insert the name of almost any country) _so we can attend?_ became the next question. 

Let me be abundantly clear that the organization was running on our _personal credit cards_ at the time. We had no money. Conference venues expect you to buy a lot of food and beverage, and after taxes and service fees that can be as much as $175 per person per day, and they expect as much as half of that _up front_ just to hold the space. For a 200-person event, we were looking at deposits in excess of $50,000. We'd already committed to running the organization as a "not for profit." That's not a legal status like nonprofit; it's a statement of intent. None of us wanted a salary or fee or anything, and so we at least only needed to float $50k of our own money on deposits.

Incidentally, that not-for-profit thing is important, because if we _made_ a profit, _we_ would have been taxed for it. "Not-for-profit" isn't the same as "nonprofit." We set up our fiscal year so that it started in November, when we opened Summit registration. That way, we'd have time to earn the money _and spend it all_ in April, so we'd minimize any tax consequences.

Anyway, doing all of that in another country was _terrifying_. But we scheduled PowerShell Summit Europe, in Amsterdam, for late 2014 anyway.

And it sold out. In fact, _every_ Summit has sold out, which has been deeply gratifying to us all. For 2014, the North America show moved to a real conference venue. For 2015, the Europe event moved to Stockholm, and North America to Charlotte, NC.

A quick aside: Stockholm was the first time we recorded Summit's breakout sessions and posted them, free, on YouTube.com. How that came to be is a pretty incredibly story of how a community can work. We'd been bugged since the beginning to record or stream sessions; major 1st-party events like Microsoft TechEd (Ignite) and VMworld made it an expectation. And we weren't generally opposed; much of what went on in our sessions was absolutely worthy of preservation. But the equipment is _expensive_. I mentioned this during a lunchtime address at Summit in 2014, and someone piped up with, "well, how expensive?" "About $10,000 to record two rooms," I replied. I'd done some research already, you see. "Do a Kickstarter!" someone yelled. Tired of the topic, I did just that. And before Summit was over, we'd raised $12,000, including funds from people not even present. Some donated as much as $1,000. So, for that Fall in Stockholm, we had recording equipment. That eventually did become burdensome to run and maintain, and for 2018 we hired Confreaks.com to record everything, since we'd gotten large enough to spread that overhead--roughly $30,000--across all the attendees without making too much of an increase in ticket prices.

After Stockholm, we declared that we'd proven a European event could exist and thrive, and that someone else--ideally some Europeans--needed to run it from there. The taxes were problematic: we didn't want to establish a business nexus in Europe and wind up owing God-knows-what taxes over there, and running the event in August or September or whatever was causing money to "cross" our fiscal year boundary, resulting in unpleasant taxes on "profit" in the US. It's also difficult and exhausting to run an event _in your spare time_ in a different country. Bear in mind that we all had real jobs; figuring out venues, food service, hotel space, and everything else from 8 or 9 time zones away was monstrous, to say nothing of flying over there for a week and putting on a show. By the time each European event was over, we were homesick, felt like we were just "going through the motions," and generally tired. Fortunately, some Europeans stepped right up, and PSConf.eu became a thing. It's doing wonderfully as of this writing, and sells out every year.

(We're still asked when we're going to do a Summit in Australia, or New Zealand, or France, or Russia, or whatever. We're not. Folks there need to go through the same exercise we did and make it happen for themselves. PSConf.asia did it, so can you.)

Charlotte in 2015 was both an experiment and a tactical decision. We wanted to experiment with the idea of doing the East coast every other year. As an experiment, it was just so-so; we obviously couldn't have an evening reception where nearly the entire PowerShell product team showed up to mingle, because they were mostly all in Bellevue; only a few were able to fly to Charlotte to join us. The venue--again, space inside a Microsoft building--was sub-optimal, as we were spread across two floors, and had to hire a guard to shuttle people up and down in a locked-down elevator. The people were wonderful, the food was fantastic, and the attendees said they liked it, but it wasn't the Summit we'd been building to that point. Our attendee geographic distribution was about the same, indicating we hadn't gotten much of a "bump" by moving East.

But tactically, Charlotte did something deeply important: it gave us a huge profit. The costs were vastly lower, but we charged the same rate. Yeah, we owed some taxes (more on that in a bit), but it gave us enough money in the bank to prepay our deposits for venues, hotels, and so on. The organization was, finally, financially self-sufficient, and our own personal cash and lines of credit were no longer involved. 

2016, then, was back to Bellevue, and only Bellevue, for what became PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit.

Why "DevOps?"  

We wanted to take another stab at being a nonprofit.
